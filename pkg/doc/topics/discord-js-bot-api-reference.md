## What this API is for

This repository lets you write Discord bots in JavaScript while the Go host handles Discord connectivity, slash-command sync, event dispatch, and outbound operations. The JavaScript side stays small and expressive:

- you declare one bot with `defineBot(...)`
- you register commands, events, components, modals, and autocomplete handlers
- you use the provided context object to reply, defer, edit, log, persist small state, and call Discord operations

The main idea is simple: the bot repository owns the process, but the bot behavior lives in JavaScript.

## The runtime model

A bot repository is a directory tree full of bot scripts. Each script exports one bot definition through `require("discord")`.

A typical repository looks like this:

```text
examples/discord-bots/
  ping/index.js
  poker/index.js
  knowledge-base/index.js
  support/index.js
  moderation/index.js
```

The CLI discovers bots by scanning the repository, loading each script, and reading its metadata. That is why the bot name, description, commands, components, modals, and autocomplete registrations all matter: they are not just documentation, they are the contract the host uses to route interactions.

## Quick API summary

| Helper | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `defineBot(builderFn)` | Create one bot from a builder callback |
| `configure(options)` | Set bot metadata and runtime config fields |
| `command(name, spec?, handler)` | Register a slash command |
| `event(name, handler)` | Register a gateway/event handler |
| `component(customId, handler)` | Handle button or select-menu interactions |
| `modal(customId, handler)` | Handle modal submissions |
| `autocomplete(commandName, optionName, handler)` | Return autocomplete choices |

## `defineBot(builderFn)`

`defineBot(...)` is the entrypoint every bot script exports.

```js
const { defineBot } = require("discord")

module.exports = defineBot(({ command, event, configure }) => {
  configure({
    name: "ping",
    description: "A minimal example bot",
  })

  command("ping", { description: "Reply with pong" }, async () => {
    return { content: "pong" }
  })
})
```

The builder callback receives the registration helpers you ask for. If you only destructure `command` and `event`, those are the only hooks you plan to use. Most bots will ask for at least `command`, `event`, and `configure`.

## `configure(options)`

`configure(...)` stores metadata on the bot and can also describe runtime config fields.

```js
configure({
  name: "knowledge-base",
  description: "Search and summarize internal docs from JavaScript",
  category: "knowledge",
  run: {
    fields: {
      index_path: {
        type: "string",
        help: "Optional path label for the active docs index",
        default: "builtin-docs",
      },
      read_only: {
        type: "bool",
        help: "Disable write operations for future mutations",
        default: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### Metadata keys

The host keeps arbitrary metadata keys. The common ones are:

- `name` — the canonical bot name shown by `bots list` and `bots help`
- `description` — a human-readable summary
- `category` — a group label used by your own conventions
- `run` — runtime configuration schema for `bots run`

### Runtime config fields

Each field under `run.fields` becomes a CLI flag when you run the bot through `bots run <bot>`.

Rules to remember:

- field names become the keys inside `ctx.config`
- field names are also converted into kebab-case CLI flags
- the help text from `help` is shown in `bots help <bot>`
- default values are exposed to the CLI and to `ctx.config`

For example, the field `index_path` becomes the flag `--index-path` and is read in JavaScript as `ctx.config.index_path`.

Supported runtime field types are:

- `string`
- `bool` / `boolean`
- `int` / `integer`
- `number` / `float`
- `string_list` / `string-list` / `string[]`

## `command(name, spec?, handler)`

`command(...)` registers a slash command.

```js
command("echo", {
  description: "Echo text back",
  options: {
    text: {
      type: "string",
      description: "Text to echo back",
      required: true,
    },
  },
}, async (ctx) => {
  return {
    content: ctx.args.text,
    ephemeral: true,
  }
})
```

### Command specification

The runtime reads the `spec` object and converts it into a Discord application command.

The keys that matter are:

- `description` — the command description shown by Discord
- `options` — a map or array of option definitions

Use an object map when you want simple, readable declarations. Use an array if you want to preserve an explicit option list.

```js
options: {
  query: {
    type: "string",
    description: "Search query",
    required: true,
    autocomplete: true,
  },
  limit: {
    type: "integer",
    description: "Maximum results",
  },
}
```

### Supported option fields

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | Discord option type: `string`, `integer`, `bool`, `number`, `user`, `channel`, `role`, or `mentionable` |
| `description` | Option description shown in Discord |
| `required` | Marks the option as required |
| `autocomplete` | Enables autocomplete for that option |
| `choices` | Static choices for the option |
| `minLength` | Minimum length for string options |
| `maxLength` | Maximum length for string options |
| `minValue` | Minimum numeric value |
| `maxValue` | Maximum numeric value |

Important rules:

- `autocomplete: true` cannot be combined with static `choices`
- required options should be defined before optional ones in your source data
- the host preserves a sensible order when it syncs commands to Discord

### What the command handler gets

The handler receives a context object. For slash commands, the most important fields are:

- `ctx.args` — parsed option values keyed by option name
- `ctx.options` — alias of `ctx.args`
- `ctx.config` — runtime config values from `configure({ run: ... })`
- `ctx.reply(...)` — send the initial response
- `ctx.defer(...)` — acknowledge the interaction and finish later
- `ctx.edit(...)` — edit the deferred or initial response
- `ctx.followUp(...)` — send an additional follow-up
- `ctx.showModal(...)` — open a modal
- `ctx.discord` — call Discord operations directly
- `ctx.log` — structured logger for this bot context
- `ctx.store` — per-runtime in-memory state

If your command does work that might take longer than Discord likes, call `await ctx.defer({ ephemeral: true })`, do the work, and then `await ctx.edit(...)` with the result.

## `event(name, handler)`

`event(...)` registers a handler for a gateway event.

The runtime currently exposes these event names:

- `ready`
- `guildCreate`
- `guildMemberAdd`
- `guildMemberUpdate`
- `guildMemberRemove`
- `messageCreate`
- `messageUpdate`
- `messageDelete`
- `reactionAdd`
- `reactionRemove`

Example:

```js
event("messageCreate", async (ctx) => {
  const content = String((ctx.message && ctx.message.content) || "").trim()
  if (content === "!pingjs") {
    await ctx.reply({ content: "pong from messageCreate" })
  }
})
```

### Event context fields

The context depends on the event, but these fields are common:

- `ctx.message` — the current message or message-like payload
- `ctx.before` — the previous value for update/delete style events
- `ctx.user` — the user involved in the event
- `ctx.member` — the guild member involved in the event
- `ctx.guild` — the guild context when available
- `ctx.channel` — the channel context when available
- `ctx.reaction` — reaction payload for reaction events
- `ctx.me` — the bot’s current user record
- `ctx.discord` — outbound Discord operations
- `ctx.reply(...)` — send a channel response when the event supports it

For update/delete events, `ctx.before` is especially useful because it gives you the previous state. For reaction events, `ctx.reaction.emoji.name` is the easiest way to inspect what was added or removed.

### What the event handler may return

If you do not call `ctx.reply(...)`, the runtime can use the handler’s return value as a response for event-style workflows. In practice, many bots use events for side effects and explicit replies rather than relying on return values, because that keeps the flow easier to follow.

## `component(customId, handler)`

`component(...)` handles button clicks and select-menu interactions by `customId`.

```js
component("ping:panel", async () => {
  return {
    content: "Panel button clicked from JavaScript",
    ephemeral: true,
  }
})
```

Use it when your command returns a message with buttons or selects and you want those controls to be interactive.

### Component context fields

The most useful fields are:

- `ctx.component.customId` — the clicked component ID
- `ctx.component.type` — `button`, `select`, `userSelect`, `roleSelect`, `mentionableSelect`, or `channelSelect`
- `ctx.values` — selected values for select menus
- `ctx.reply(...)` — respond to the component interaction
- `ctx.defer(...)` — acknowledge the click when you need more time
- `ctx.edit(...)` — edit the original interaction response
- `ctx.showModal(...)` — open a modal from a component click

Buttons do not carry values. Select menus do. For a single-select menu, `ctx.values` is an array that usually contains one string. For multi-select menus, it can contain more.

## `modal(customId, handler)`

`modal(...)` handles modal submissions by `customId`.

```js
modal("feedback:submit", async (ctx) => {
  const summary = ctx.values && ctx.values.summary || "(empty)"
  const details = ctx.values && ctx.values.details || "(none)"
  return {
    content: `Thanks for the feedback: ${summary}\nDetails: ${details}`,
    ephemeral: true,
  }
})
```

### Modal context fields

The key field is:

- `ctx.values` — an object keyed by text input custom IDs

For text inputs, the runtime collects the submitted values into a plain object so you can read them directly by name.

## `autocomplete(commandName, optionName, handler)`

`autocomplete(...)` supplies suggestions while the user is typing a slash-command option.

```js
autocomplete("search", "query", async (ctx) => {
  const current = String(ctx.focused && ctx.focused.value || "")
  return [
    { name: "Architecture", value: "architecture" },
    { name: "Testing", value: "testing" },
    { name: `Custom: ${current || "query"}`, value: current || "custom" },
  ]
})
```

### Autocomplete context fields

- `ctx.focused` — the currently focused option
- `ctx.args` — the parsed option map for the command
- `ctx.command` — the command metadata
- `ctx.config` — runtime config values
- `ctx.discord` — outbound Discord operations

### Autocomplete return values

Return an array of choices. Each choice should have:

- `name`
- `value`

The runtime will keep at most 25 choices, because that is Discord’s limit.

## Response payloads

Most handlers can return either a string or an object. Returning a string becomes the message content. Returning an object lets you build richer replies.

Common response fields are:

- `content`
- `embeds`
- `components`
- `files`
- `allowedMentions`
- `tts`
- `ephemeral`
- `replyTo`

Example:

```js
return {
  content: "Search results",
  embeds: [
    {
      title: "Architecture",
      description: "Bot wiring, handlers, and runtime layers.",
      color: 0x5865F2,
    },
  ],
  ephemeral: true,
}
```

### Deferred response pattern

For slow work, use the defer/edit pattern:

```js
await ctx.defer({ ephemeral: true })
await ctx.edit({ content: "Searching for arch..." })
await sleep(2000)
await ctx.edit({ content: "Results for arch: ..." })
```

This is the right pattern for commands that need to perform a search, call an API, or otherwise wait before replying.

## `ctx.store`

`ctx.store` is a per-runtime in-memory key/value store.

It is useful for lightweight bot state such as counters, current hand state, or temporary caches.

```js
const hits = ctx.store.get("hits", 0)
ctx.store.set("hits", hits + 1)
```

Available methods:

- `get(key, defaultValue)`
- `set(key, value)`
- `delete(key)`
- `keys(prefix)`
- `namespace(...parts)`

Important behavior:

- state lives only in memory
- it is lost when the bot process restarts
- use `namespace(...)` to keep per-bot or per-channel state separate

## `ctx.log`

`ctx.log` is a structured logger for the current bot context.

```js
ctx.log.info("js discord bot connected", {
  user: ctx.me && ctx.me.username,
  script: ctx.metadata && ctx.metadata.scriptPath,
})
```

Available levels:

- `info`
- `debug`
- `warn`
- `error`

Any field object you pass is merged into the structured log output.

## `ctx.discord`

`ctx.discord` exposes outbound Discord operations for when a command or event needs to do more than answer the original interaction.

### Channel and message operations

| Operation | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ctx.discord.channels.send(channelId, payload)` | Send a normal message to a channel |
| `ctx.discord.messages.edit(channelId, messageId, payload)` | Edit an existing channel message |
| `ctx.discord.messages.delete(channelId, messageId)` | Delete a channel message |
| `ctx.discord.messages.react(channelId, messageId, emoji)` | Add a reaction to a channel message |

### Guild member operations

| Operation | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ctx.discord.members.addRole(guildId, userId, roleId)` | Add a role to a member |
| `ctx.discord.members.removeRole(guildId, userId, roleId)` | Remove a role from a member |
| `ctx.discord.members.timeout(guildId, userId, payload)` | Set or clear a member timeout |
| `ctx.discord.members.kick(guildId, userId, payload)` | Kick a member |
| `ctx.discord.members.ban(guildId, userId, payload)` | Ban a member |
| `ctx.discord.members.unban(guildId, userId)` | Remove a ban |

### Common payload shapes

Channel send and interaction response payloads support a shared shape:

- `content` — message text
- `embeds` — one or more embeds
- `components` — buttons and select menus
- `files` — attachments like `{ name, content, contentType }`
- `allowedMentions` — mention policy
- `tts` — text-to-speech flag
- `replyTo` — message reference for channel messages

For `ctx.discord.channels.send(...)`, the payload is a normal message payload. For interaction responses, you can also use `ephemeral: true` to keep the response private.

### Files and replies

A file attachment looks like this:

```js
files: [
  {
    name: "report.txt",
    content: "This report was created inside the JS bot runtime.",
  },
]
```

A reply reference looks like this:

```js
replyTo: {
  messageId: "orig-1",
  channelId: "chan-1",
}
```

## Common mistakes and how to avoid them

### 1. Using static choices and autocomplete together

You can use one or the other, not both. If you want typed suggestions, keep `autocomplete: true` and remove `choices`.

### 2. Forgetting to `defer()` for slow commands

If a command does real work after submission, call `ctx.defer(...)` and then edit the response later. That keeps Discord happy and gives the user immediate feedback.

### 3. Reusing the same `customId` in multiple bots

Custom IDs must be unique across loaded bots. The host will reject duplicate component IDs, modal IDs, and autocomplete pairs.

### 4. Assuming `ctx.store` survives restarts

It does not. If you need durability, store state in a real database or file on the host side.

### 5. Expecting `ctx.discord.channels.send(...)` to behave like an ephemeral interaction reply

It is a normal channel message. Use interaction replies when you want ephemeral/private behavior.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bot selector is required` when trying to run a bot | The named bot was omitted from `bots run` | Use `discord-bot bots run <bot>` |
| `javascript bot script is required` on direct `run` or `sync-commands` | No explicit `--bot-script` or `DISCORD_BOT_SCRIPT` was provided | Prefer `bots run <bot>` or pass `--bot-script` explicitly |
| A slash command never appears in Discord | Commands were not synced after editing the bot | Run with `--sync-on-start` or use the sync command path |
| A component or modal interaction says no handler exists | The `customId` does not match the registered `component(...)` or `modal(...)` key | Keep `customId` values stable and unique |
| `ctx.config` is missing expected fields | The bot did not declare `configure({ run: ... })` fields or the flags were omitted | Add the run schema and pass the generated flags to `bots run` |
| A message/channel moderation helper fails | The bot lacks the required channel permissions | Check message-management, channel-management, and read/history permissions for the target channel |
